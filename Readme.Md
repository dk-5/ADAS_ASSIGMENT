1. How You Processed the Data
•	Data Acquisition:
The code begins by loading images from a specified input directory (in this case, the KITTI dataset images). It processes the first 1000 images to simulate a continuous data stream.
•	Pre-processing:
For each image, the code:
o	Reads the image using OpenCV.
o	Converts the image from BGR (OpenCV default) to RGB since the YOLOv5 model expects RGB input.
•	Inference:
The pre-trained YOLOv5 model is then applied to the RGB image to perform object detection. The model returns detection outputs in the form of bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class indices.
•	Storing Results:
The detection results (object vectors) are stored in a dictionary and later saved as a JSON file. Additionally, the code overlays the detections (bounding boxes and labels) on the image and saves the processed image for later analysis.

2. The Sensor Fusion Techniques You Applied
•	Calibration-Based Projection:
The code uses calibration files (from the KITTI dataset) to extract calibration matrices. In particular, the P2 matrix is used to project 3D points (simulated radar or LIDAR data) into the 2D image space.
•	Correlation via Center Matching:
For sensor fusion, dummy radar objects (simulated LIDAR data) with known 3D centroids are adjusted by an offset and then projected onto the image. Their projected 2D points are compared with the centers of the detected bounding boxes (from YOLOv5).
o	The Euclidean distance between the projected radar point and the detection centers is computed.
o	If a radar point is within a threshold (e.g., 50 pixels) of a detection, the two are considered to be correlated (or “fused”), and a fused center is computed as the average of the detection center and the projected radar point.
•	Feature Refinement:
Although not extensively detailed, the code also extracts contours from the ROI of each detection, which can serve as an additional refinement step by capturing the object's shape.

3. How You Integrated the Camera and LIDAR Data
•	Synchronization via Calibration:
Integration is achieved by using the calibration data to map LIDAR (or dummy radar) 3D points into the camera’s 2D image space. This ensures that both the camera detections and the LIDAR/radar measurements are in the same coordinate system.
•	Matching Detections to Radar Data:
Once the radar data is projected into the image, the system compares it with the object vectors from the camera. The centers of the bounding boxes from the camera are matched to the projected radar points based on a proximity threshold. This results in “fused” objects that combine appearance (from the camera) with spatial information (from LIDAR/radar).
•	Fused Data Structure:
The fused result for each correlated detection includes:
o	The original camera detection bounding box.
o	The corresponding radar object (with its 3D centroid).
o	The projected radar point on the image.
o	The fused center (computed as an average of the camera detection center and the projected radar point).

4. The Collision Avoidance Algorithm and Its Results
•	Obstruction Identification:
The code employs a YOLOv5-based approach on the region-of-interest (ROI) of each detection to check for potential obstructions. A predefined set of obstruction classes (such as "person," "car," "truck," etc.) is used to determine if the detected object represents a potential hazard.
•	Decision Making:
In the decision-making step, if any fused object is classified as an obstruction, the system triggers a collision risk decision. This is simulated by overlaying a warning message (e.g., "ALERT: Collision Risk Detected!") on the processed image and printing out the corresponding action (like automated braking, lane change avoidance, and ACC).
•	Results Visualization:
The final output images include:
o	Red bounding boxes from the original camera detections.
o	Green circles indicating the radar-projected points.
o	Yellow (or differently colored) markers indicating the fused centers.
o	Overlaid alert text if the system detects a collision risk.
These visual cues help to differentiate the steps and demonstrate how the system integrates sensor data to identify potential hazards.
